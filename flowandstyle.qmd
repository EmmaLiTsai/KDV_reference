# KDV Workflow and Style

No project will perfectly fit a standard mold, but aiming to follow a general set of methods makes it easier to collaborate in code development and maintain code products.

## Project Organization

-   note function for new project folder prep

## Data Style

-   all caps column names

-   neverstart with numbers; if numbers use leading zeros for alphanumeric sort

-   if dates, always yyyy-mm-dd

## Code Style

-   generally Tidyverse (provide link to tidyverse style resources; offer kdv lintr as a resource, recommend settings in RStudio)

-   with some exceptions (list main exceptions)

-   general value of readability/accessibility/reproducibility over efficiency  - unless working with very large data where nanoseconds saved in efficiency add up to hours

-   unless otherwise specified, always theme_bw(), always centered title - note existence of KDV color palettes and ggplot theme
