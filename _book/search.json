Any supporting documentation or correspondance regarding the raw data should be saved in the same raw data folder as the data itself. Only in very rare circumstances would raw data be edited outside an R script. If this is required, a README_kdv_raw_data_edits.txt file should be added to the raw data folder. If possible, the edits should be made to a copy of the raw data. The goal is to always have an original unmodified copy of the raw data along with all associated explanatory correspondence located in the same location."

A series of tests should be applied prior to saving to ensure all data meet the agreed standards."
